# STANDUP 01 - 2/9/2023 TEAM SWARTHMORE

General Update and Intro
====================================================================
- Teams assembled and introduced, selected Project Leaders: Jean and Richard
- Talked to TA and client
- Figured out which tools we are gonna be using and learning (WebGl, ThreeJs/XTK and NodeJs)
- Played around with 10 PRINT 3D (goxtk.com)
- Looked over framework on fundamentals 

Draft of Requirements
=====================================================================
- Have a dashboard where people can select different settings that generates a 3d art using an algorithm
- We will need to design 3 algorithms that generate 3D art that can be started, paused, and reset.
- A digital canvas that can be drawn to using client-side js and node js. 
- Drawing must happen within a web browser on a client’s device without networking, or in a terminal with node js.
- Provide a full spec of drawing commands to be used on the digital canvas.

For technologies we propose:
- WebGL for drawing 3D shapes on a 2D canvas.
- ThreeJs/XTK for connecting the WebGL art to the browser
- NodeJS and headless-gl for connecting the WebGL art to the terminal


Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=====================================================================
- We need a better understanding of 3D art generation to understand what is and isn’t possible
- We need to explore algorithms that have already been explored in 3D art generation to avoid recreating something that already exists
